Firest create the mycode.py name file add the csv data into it.
Now install the DVC into the terminal using (pip install DVC)
Now Initilize the DVC using DVC init.
After that making the local s3 bucket or say local folder to store the data versions in that folder.(mkdir name of directory )
Now initilizing the remote path (dvc remote add -d myremote s3)
Now adding the path of the data same like git (command dvc add data/){
    but this will give us error it say that the file is already tracked by the git so we need to distrack the file using the command 
    "git rm-r --cached 'file name' " after that also commit it 

}now again the same the command (dvc add data/ )
after adding the data make it commit and push
